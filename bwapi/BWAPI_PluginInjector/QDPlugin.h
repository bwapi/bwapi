/*
  QDPlugin.h
  The central hive of the MPQDraft plugin system.

  In addition to the standard MPQ "adding" functionality of MPQDraft,
  MPQDraft also supports a powerful plugin system to acommodate addition
  methods of patching. These plugins are specially constructed DLLs which
  1) Export the GetMPQDraftPlugin function, and 2) Impliment the
  IMPQDraftPlugin interface. Up to 8 plugins may be loaded in one patching
  session (although 8 is a rather arbitrary number, and may be changed in
  later versions, if there is reason to do so).

  - PLUGIN MODULES -
  MPQDraft supports the creation of completely self-contained SEMPQs. But,
  this ability creates a palette of problems all its own. All of a plugin's
  data files have to be packed into the SEMPQ. This means that a special
  mechanism is needed, to marshall the data files from the plugin to the
  SEMPQ, and back to the plugin; this is the plugin module system. Each data
  file of the plugin is referred to as a "module", and identified by
  a pair of DWORDs: a plugin ID, and a module ID. The plugin ID is the
  globally unique ID of the plugin; the module ID is the plugin-specific ID
  of the module.

  [FURTHER TEXT TO BE ADDED HERE]

  - SETUP SIDE -
  There are two halves to each plugin: a setup side and a patching side. The
  setup side is when the plugin gets loaded in MPQDraft, and displayed in
  the plugin list, in either the patching wizard or SEMPQ wizard.
  Specifically, MPQDraft loads all plugins when the plugins page in the
  wizard first gets activated. The plugins will remain loaded until the
  wizard is closed. If a patch is performed, the plugins will remain loaded
  until the patch is completed. This allows plugins to get the opportunity
  to delete any temporary files that were created for the patch.

  Order and timing of calls to setup-side plugin functions:

  When the plugins wizard page is first activated, and MPQDraft is building
  its plugin database:
  1. The plugin gets loaded with LoadLibrary.
  2. The plugin's GetMPQDraftPlugin function gets called to obtain the
  plugin's IMPQDraftPlugin interface.
  3. IMPQDraftPlugin::Identify gets called.
  4. IMPQDraftPlugin::GetPluginName gets called.

  Each time the plugins page is switched to, MPQDraft determines which
  plugins to display in the plugin list:
  - IMPQDraftPlugin::CanPatchExecutable gets called for the currently
  selected executable. If the plugin can patch the executable, it will
  appear in the plugin list if it can't, then it won't appear. NOTE: this
  step does not occur when selecting plugins for use in an SEMPQ. In this
  case, ALL plugins will be available to select.

  If the "Configure" button is clicked while a plugin is selected:
  - IMPQDraftPlugin::Configure is called, with the HWND to the wizard in
  use. This allows the plugin to create a modal dialog with various plugin
  settings.

  If the "Finish" button is clicked to initiate a patch:
  1. IMPQDraftPlugin::ReadyForPatch is called to discern whether the plugin
  is properly configured, and ready to perform the patch.
  2. IMPQDraftPlugin::GetModules is called to obtain the number of plugin
  modules the plugin will require.
  3. IMPQDraftPlugin::GetModule is called again to get the plugin's modules.

  Either after the patch is completed or the wizard is cancelled:
  - FreeLibrary is called to unload the plugin. The plugin is responsible
  for cleaning up any data files it created temporarily.

  NOTE: Plugins will not be loaded in setup-side when an SEMPQ is executed.

  - PATCHING SIDE -
  The patching side is when a plugin gets loaded by the MPQDraft patching
  kernel. The plugin will be loaded inside the patchee (the process being
  patched) BEFORE any patchee code gets executed, but after any DLLs the
  patchee uses are loaded and initialized (DllMain is called). This means
  that plugins will be able to modify initialized data in the patchee, but
  not uninitialized data. If the latter is necessary, a thread can be
  spawned by the plugin to wait until the data has been initialized.

  Order and timing of calls to patching-side plugin functions:

  After MPQDraft performs its own initializations, it will load each
  selected plugin (this is done before any MPQs are loaded):
  1. LoadLibrary gets called to load the plugin inside the patch target.
  2. GetMPQDraftPlugin gets called to obtain an IMPQDraftPlugin interface.
  3. IMPQDraftPlugin::InitializePlugin gets called with a pointer to the
  MPQDraft server interface, to allow the plugin to locate its data files.

  When the patchee is closing down, and MPQDraft is terminating:
  1. IMPQDraftPlugin::TerminatePlugin gets called to remove any patches the
  plugin performed.
  2. The plugin is unloaded with FreeLibrary.

    Parameters:

    IMPQDraftPlugin::GetModules

    if a straight patch is being performed, MPQDraft will just pass on the
    module list to the patching kernel.

    Returns TRUE on success, and FALSE on failure.

    Parameters:
      lpPluginModules [out] - A pointer to the memory MPQDraft has

      module it will require in the patching process. When MPQDraft
      first calls GetModules, lpPluginModules will be NULL.
      lpnNumModules [out] - A pointer to the number of plugin modules

      - If an error occurs, and GetModules is unable to supply the
      required information, GetModules will fail. In this case, MPQDraft
      will abort the patch.

      - If lpPluginModules is non-NULL, GetModules will copy the
      list of modules to lpPluginModules, and give the number of modules
