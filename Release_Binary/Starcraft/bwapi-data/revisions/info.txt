INSTRUCTIONS
  - Download or compile the version of BWAPI that the AI dll uses.
  - Copy that revision's "BWAPI.dll" to the "bwapi-data\revisions\" folder.
  - Rename that revision's "BWAPI.dll" to the revision number ("####.dll" or "####d.dll").
  - Specify the revision in ai_dll_rev or ai_dll_#_rev in bwapi.ini.
  
  Example: I have BWAPI Beta 3.3 and want to run a RELEASE AI module for BWAPI Beta 3.1 (revision 2796).
           I download BWAPI Beta 3.1, copy "BWAPI.dll" to the "bwapi-data\revisions\" folder and rename it to "2796.dll".
           I uncomment "ai_dll_rev" in the configuration and set it to 2796.
           I run BWAPI and it loads the older revision automatically.
  
  Also works with multiple instances, though not all revisions are compatible.
  Match a revision with a released version below.
