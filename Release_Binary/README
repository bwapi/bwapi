1. Introduction to BWAPI
------------------------

   The Brood War Application Programming Interface (BWAPI) is a free and open
source C++ framework for creating AI modules for Starcraft: Broodwar. Using
BWAPI, programmers can retrieve information on players and individual units
in Starcraft as well as issue a wide variety of commands to units, opening
the doors for custom AIs with new micro and macro algorithms.

   This zip has all the necessary include files, libs, and dlls required to
compile and run an AI module and also comes with three projects to help get
you started in AI development with BWAPI:

  - Example AI Module - This project shows how to build an AI module DLL which
                        is the standard way of making autonomous agents with
                        BWAPI. The Example AI Module shows how to print
                        "Hello world!" along with a bit of example code that
                        shows how to read information about the units in the
                        game.

  - Example AI Client - This project shows how to build an AI client program,
                        which is an experimental new way of making AIs for
                        BWAPI. Like the Example AI Module project, this
                        project shows how to print "Hello world!" along with a
                        bit of example code that shows how to read information
                        about the units in the game.

  - AI Module Loader  - This project is a very simple AI client program which
                        can load and run Example AI Module DLLs, essentially
                        a way of making your AI Module run in a seperate
                        process without actually converting it to a client
                        program.

Build Instructions:

1. Extract the entire zip to a folder on your computer.

2. Copy the contents of Chaoslauncher/Release/ to your Chaos Launcher folder.

3. Copy the contents of Starcraft/ to your actual Starcraft folder.

4. Copy the contents of WINDOWS/ to your C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT folder (which
   ever your version of Windows has).

5. Open ExampleProjects.sln in VC++ 2008 SP1 or VC++ 2008 Express Edition and
   compile the project as RELEASE.
   To do this:
   5.1. Change the dropdown box in the top center of the window from "Debug" to
        "Release".
   5.2. Click Build -> Build Solution. The Example AI Module is now compiled
        into a dll.

All three projects are now built. To run the Example AI Module:

1. Copy Release/ExampleAIModule.dll to
   <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/AI/ExampleAIModule.dll

2. Open <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini and set ai_dll to
   ExampleAIMdoule.dll if it isn't already.
   
3. Run Chaoslauncher with BWAPI Injector checked. You can also check W-MODE
   to have Broodwar run in a window rather than full-screen.

4. Start Starcraft: Broodwar and create a match.

   
To run the Example AI Client:

1. Open <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/bwapi.ini and set ai_dll to NULL (or some
   other file name that doesn't exist).

2. Run Release/ExampleAIClient.exe

3. Run Chaoslauncher with BWAPI Injector checked.

4. Start Starcraft: Broodwar and create a match.


Debug Mode
----------
To run either the Example AI Module or the Example AI Client in debug mode,
compile the projects in DEBUG mode and copy the files from
Chaoslauncher/Debug/ to your Chaoslauncher folder.

2. The BroodWar Terrain Analyzer
--------------------------------

   This release of BWAPI also comes with BWTA, the Brood War Terrain
Analyzer, which analyzes the map and locates the choke points and possible
expansion locations. BWTA is still a work-in-progress and does not work on
every map, so it may crash the game. To run BWTA and analyze a map, type
"/analyze" in the game chat while playing a match with either the Example AI
Module loaded or the Example AI Client running. This will freeze the game for
a couple minutes while BWTA analyzes the map. Once BWTA is done analyzing the
map, the game will unfreeze and superimpose the outlines of regions,
chokepoints, and base locations on the screen using BWAPI's draw commands.

3. Basic AI Module
------------------

   The Example AI Module mainly just shows how to set everything up to make an
AI module for BWAPI. Once you understand how the Example AI Module works, you
may be interested the Basic AI Module from the BWSAL project, which aims to
develop several robust components which execute basic tasks, such as
constructing buildings, training units, gathering resources, and build-order
management. For more information, visit:  http://code.google.com/p/bwsal/

4. Bug Reports
--------------

   BWAPI is currently in beta, so as you write custom AI modules using BWAPI
you may run into bugs or other problems. We cannot find all the bugs on our own
so as a beta tester your feedback is invaluable and can be very helpful for
improving BWAPI. When you find a bug, please describe what the bug is and, if
possible, how to reproduce the bug and post the report in either a new issue at
   http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/issues/list

or in a message to the bwapi google group at
   http://groups.google.com/group/bwapi

Additionally, the contents of the BWAPI global log may prove useful in tracking
down the bug, so when appropriate please include relevant contents of the file
   <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/logs/global.log

in your bug report. Thank you for beta testing BWAPI.
