# The Brood War API #

## Overview ##

The Brood War Application Programming Interface (BWAPI) is a free and open source C++ framework that is 
used to interact with the popular Real Time Strategy (RTS) game Starcraft: Broodwar. Using BWAPI, 
students, researchers, and hobbyists can create Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that play the game.

BWAPI only reveals the visible parts of the game state to AI modules by default. Information on units 
that have gone back into the fog of war is denied to the AI. This enables programmers to write competitive 
non-cheating AIs that must plan and operate under partial information conditions. BWAPI also denies 
user input by default, ensuring the user cannot take control of game units while the AI is playing. 
These defaults can be changed for flexibility, unless enforced by a Tournament Module (game referee for 
AI tournaments). Changed defaults will be advertised when the match begins.

## What You Can Do ##

 - Write competitive AIs for Starcraft: Broodwar by controlling individual units.
 - Read all relevant aspects of the game state.
 - Analyze replays frame-by-frame, and extract trends, build orders, and common strategies.
 - Get comprehensive information on the unit types, upgrades, technologies, weapons, and more.
 - Study and research real-time AI algorithms in a robust commercial RTS environment.
